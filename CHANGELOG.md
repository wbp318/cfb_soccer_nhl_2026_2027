# Changelog

All notable changes to `cfb_edge.py` and the analysis loop. Rule changes cite the analysis
run that justified them; nothing in the constants block changes without one. Weekly report
releases (`<weekday>-<date>` tags) are not listed here; see the GitHub releases page.

## [2026-09-29 late] — License covers the simulations and pick boards

- `LICENSE` and the README license section now name the gamma-Poisson dispersion fit, the
  same-game correlation estimates, the Monte Carlo card simulation, and the pick boards
  (just-win, agreement, lock + five); section 2 adds simulations and picks to the outputs that
  can't be used without a license. Terms unchanged: proprietary, all rights reserved, view
  only, commercial licenses available.

## [2026-09-29 evening] — NHL simulations: gamma-Poisson saves, card Monte Carlo, analysis/06 D

### Added
- **Rate uncertainty** (`nb_cdf`, `count_cdf`, `p_over(..., disp)`, `DISPERSION`,
  `DISPERSION_GRID`): a player's rate is Gamma(shape k) around the projection, the count
  Poisson(λ), which is negative binomial in closed form (a test checks it against 200k simulated draws).
  `--calibrate` now prints the log-loss for every k. Walk-forward 2025-26: shots best at ∞
  (Poisson), points flat (0.6096 at ∞ and 50), **saves 0.6131 → 0.6032 at k = 20** (naive
  0.6162). So `DISPERSION = {"saves": 20}`; skaters unchanged. `SAVES_MAX_STRENGTH` stays 1
  until the ledger speaks.
- **`simulate_card`**: 20,000-night Monte Carlo of the lock + five (seed 20260929). Each ticket
  keeps its own probability; teammates correlate through a one-factor Gaussian copula at
  `TEAM_RHO` (points 0.107, assists 0.055; opponents independent). Run under the model's
  probabilities and under the de-vigged market; reports expected hits, P(all), P(≥ n−1),
  flat-$1 mean / P(up) / 5th–95th, and parlay EV. In the terminal under the lock and in the report
  as **Simulated 20,000 nights of that card**. Opening night: model 4.45/6 hits, P(up) 51%,
  +$0.42; market 3.89/6, P(up) 31%, −$0.38.
- `analysis/06_nhl` (Python + R): C gets the dispersion grid (and the model row uses k = 20 for
  saves); new **D. same-game correlation**: pooled Pearson r of "had ≥ 1" over 710,554
  teammate pairs and 752,208 opponent pairs, closed form from per-team sums, latent
  ρ = sin(πr/2). Points r 0.0684 (ρ 0.1073), assists r 0.0350 (ρ 0.0549), opponents −0.008 /
  −0.004. Output `nhl_correlation.csv`. **Python == R: max |Δ| 8e-15 (calibration), 3e-16
  (correlation)**; both run clean on an empty DB.
- `numpy` added to `requirements.txt` (the card simulation). Tests
  `test_nb_cdf_matches_simulated_gamma_poisson_and_tends_to_poisson`,
  `test_simulate_card_keeps_marginals_and_correlates_teammates`; the saves signal test moved
  to line 24.5 because k = 20 widens the distribution (85 cases).
- README: a Simulations section with its own diagram, an updated calibration table, and
  updates to the architecture, flag-flow, analysis and CI diagrams. `analysis/README.md`,
  `betting_guide.md` and `CLAUDE.md` updated too.

### Why
- The user asked for simulations. The honest outcome: rate uncertainty only helps saves, and the
  card simulation shows the lock + five is a coin flip to finish up even if the model is right.

## [2026-09-29] — NHL opening night: lock + five, DraftKings via ESPN, `agree` bucket

### Added
- **`agree_signal` / `agree_board` / `lock_and_good` / `render_lock`** in `nhl_edge.py`, and a
  report section **The lock, and five good ones** above §1. The football just-win idea applied
  to props: the side the projection and the de-vigged line both call > 50%, priced −250..−110
  (`AGREE_MIN_PRICE` / `AGREE_MAX_PRICE`), model over fair by 0..+20% (`AGREE_MAX_GAP_PCT`,
  because every run so far says bigger gaps lose), never saves (weakest projection), never
  ⚠thin. Ranked by model chance to cash, best book per player × market. Good picks are the
  rest of that board, then the value board, one per player (`GOOD_PICKS_N = 5`).
- Agreement plays are paper-logged as kind **`agree`** (strength 1). `db_paper_log` now dedupes
  per (game, player, market, **kind**) so an agree play and a value play on the same prop both
  count. **No track record yet**; `LIVE_STAKES` unchanged.
- **`fetch_props_espn`**: DraftKings two-sided player totals (SOG, points, assists, blocks,
  saves) from ESPN's keyless core `propBets` feed, used when there is no `ODDS_API_KEY` and no
  `--lines-file`. Pairs arrive Over first with no side label; checked on the opening-night
  feed (Matthews 0.5 PTS −195 / +145, Ekman-Larsson +230 / −320). One-sided markets
  (milestones, scorer props) are skipped because they can't be de-vigged.
- `analysis/06_nhl` (Python + R): loaders select `kind`; section A prints `kind:prop` and
  `kind:agree` rows, and the market × side × strength buckets are the value board only.
  Checked on a scratch copy of the ledger with fake grades: point estimates identical in
  both runtimes, bootstrap CIs within the last digit; both run clean on an empty DB.
- Tests: `test_agree_signal_window_and_gap`, `test_lock_and_good_one_per_player`,
  `test_fetch_props_espn_pairs_over_then_under`, `test_paper_log_keeps_agree_and_prop_buckets_apart`
  (83 cases).

### Fixed
- `SEASON_START` was 2026-10-07; the NHL regular season opened **2026-09-29** (schedule API,
  gameType 2). Docs updated.

### Why
- Opening night, and the user asked for one lock and five good props: winners, not outliers.
  Sanity check before publishing: the lock (Suzuki over 0.5 PTS, model 76% vs fair 65%) had a
  point in 77% of his 82 games in 2025-26, so the gap is not a rate bug.

## [2026-09-26] — Just-win board (football)

### Added
- **`just_win_signal` / `just_win_board` / `render_just_win`** in `cfb_edge.py` and report
  section **0b. Just-win board**. The opposite question from the outlier board: who is going
  to win outright at a price worth holding. A side qualifies when FPI gives it ≥ 60% to win
  (`JUST_WIN_MIN_P`), the market also favours it, the moneyline is in −250..−110
  (`JUST_WIN_PRICE`), FPI is ahead of the de-vigged price by 0..+20%
  (`JUST_WIN_MAX_EDGE_PCT = ML_STRONG_PCT`, because every run so far says bigger gaps lose),
  the ticket is +EV at the vigged price, both teams are FBS and the spread has not moved
  ≥ 1.5 pts against it. Ranked by FPI win probability; the report bolds the top 5
  (`JUST_WIN_N`). Printed after the picks board in the terminal too.
- Every qualifying side is paper-logged as kind `just-win` (strength 1, graded like a
  moneyline) so `analysis/01` gets its own bucket. **No track record yet**; `LIVE_STAKES`
  unchanged.
- **Report opens with “The lock, and five good ones”** (`lock_and_good`, `GOOD_PICKS_N = 5`):
  the lock is the top of the just-win board; good picks are the rest of that board, then the
  picks board in rank order, one per game. Same-day refresh release `saturday-2026-09-26-HHMM`.
- Tests `test_just_win_board_favourites_at_a_holdable_price` and
  `test_lock_and_good_picks_lead_with_just_win_then_outliers` (79 cases). README signal table
  and both football diagrams, `betting_guide.md` §1–§2, `CLAUDE.md` updated.

### Why
- The user asked for "winners with a decent line", not outliers. First cut of 2026-09-26
  ranked five; Mississippi State −230 showed FPI 67% vs fair 67% and −3.3% EV, so the +EV
  gate was added and it dropped to four honest sides.

## [2026-09-20h] — Every language counts on the GitHub language bar

- `.gitattributes` rewritten: every extension linguist would hide as documentation, data or
  configuration is now `linguist-detectable` with an explicit language — Python, R, RMarkdown,
  Jupyter, SQL, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Batchfile, PowerShell, Shell, YAML, TOML,
  JSON, INI, CSV, Text, Markdown, Dockerfile, Makefile, plus `.gitattributes` and `.gitignore`
  themselves. `.github/`, `reports/`, `analysis/` and `tests/` are un-vendored and
  un-generated. Line endings pinned to LF, CRLF for `.bat`, `.cmd`, `.ps1`. Linguist language
  names with spaces use the hyphenated aliases (git rejects quoted values). README files table
  gained the row.

## [2026-09-20g] — License covers all three tools

- `LICENSE` and the README license section now name `soccer_edge.py`, `nhl_edge.py`, the R
  scripts, `CHANGELOG.md`, the projection and Elo models, and player props explicitly. Terms
  unchanged: proprietary, all rights reserved, view only, commercial licenses available.

## [2026-09-20f] — analysis/06: the NHL analysis loop (Python + R)

### Added
- **`analysis/06_nhl/nhl_loop.{py,R}`** + `_shared/load_nhl.{py,R}`. A. prop ROI by market ×
  side × strength with bootstrap CI and B. slices by edge band / market / side (both empty until
  2026-10-07); C. walk-forward projection calibration on the 46,551 stored game-log rows,
  re-implementing the shrinkage + recent-10 + Poisson recipe in both runtimes. All 27
  calibration rows agree to 1e-15 and match `nhl_edge.py --calibrate`: shots log-loss 0.4742
  vs naive 0.5397, points 0.6097 vs 0.6543, saves 0.6131 vs 0.6162. CI runs both against an
  empty `CFB_NHL_DB`.

### Docs
- README: overview, inside-analysis, analysis-loop, weekly-loop, NHL-week and CI diagrams show
  `06`; running blocks, NHL status, roadmap and file table updated. `analysis/README.md`
  (layout, diagram, running, wiring-back), `CLAUDE.md`. 27 Mermaid blocks parse.

## [2026-09-20e] — NHL player-prop module, repo renamed to cfb_soccer_nhl_2026_2027

### Added
- **`nhl_edge.py`** for the 2026-27 season: skater SOG / PTS / G / A / BLK / PPP and goalie
  SV props. `--build` stores rosters (32 clubs, 1,286 players) and game logs for 2025-26 and
  2026-27 from the NHL public API (46,551 rows). Projection = current-season rate shrunk to
  last season (20 games) with a 35% tilt to the last 10, × opponent shots/goals allowed vs
  league (clamped 0.80–1.20), × 1.02 at home → Poisson P(over), push-conditioned on whole
  lines. Lines from The Odds API (`ODDS_API_KEY` env / `.env`) or `--lines-file` CSV;
  DraftKings' API returns 403. Signals +8% value / +15% STRONG / ≥ +30% ⚠overreach;
  ⚠thin < 10 games; ⚠saves-model caps goalie saves at value; ⚠not-starter. `--settle`
  grades from boxscores (PPP from the game log) and stores blocked shots.
- **`--calibrate`**: walk-forward on 2025-26 with no prior season (harder than live). Shots
  over 2.5: log-loss 0.4742 vs naive 0.5397, bins within 2 pp. Points over 0.5: 0.6097 vs
  0.6543. Saves over 27.5: 0.6131 vs 0.6162 — barely better, miscalibrated at both ends,
  hence the cap. No historical prop prices exist, so ROI is untested until the season.
- `tests/test_nhl_edge.py` (12 cases, no network); CI compiles, lints, tests, `--help`s and
  bootstraps `nhl_ci.db`. Opening-night projections report `reports/nhl-wednesday-2026-10-07.md`.

### Changed
- Repo renamed **`cfb_pro_soccer_2026` → `cfb_soccer_nhl_2026_2027`** (GitHub redirects).
  Local folder unchanged. Repo description updated.
- README: title, intro, quick start, clone URL, overview diagram (NHL subgraph), new "NHL
  player props" section with flags, data-source, worked-projection, ER and weekly diagrams
  plus the calibration table; files and roadmap. `CLAUDE.md`, `betting_guide.md` (new §5
  soccer, §6 NHL), `analysis/README.md`.
- Diagrams: overview guard-rail and CI blocks now say 77 tests (47 football · 18 soccer ·
  12 NHL) and list all three modules in the compile step. 27 Mermaid blocks parse.

## [2026-09-20d] — Soccer strategy inverted: small edges only

Sunday 2026-09-20 live: 58 settled soccer paper plays went 16-42 (−$17.71 on $123). Re-ran
`analysis/05` on 287 bets (Python == R).

### Changed (rules — from analysis/05, 287 bets)
- **Tiers inverted.** `[8%, 15%)` → STRONG 3W (44% hit, +3.4% flat, n=66 — the only band
  near break-even); `[15%, 20%)` → 3W value (34%); `≥ 20%` → strength 0, ⚠overreach
  (n=177, 29% hit, −13%). Hit rate fell monotonically with edge across five bands, the same
  shape football's Δ8+ showed. Constants: `EDGE_STRONG_MAX`, `EDGE_VALUE_MAX`,
  `EDGE_OVERREACH_PCT`; `ML_STRONG_PCT` removed.
- **Dogs beyond +250 never staked** (95 bets, 21% hit, −12%); was "cap at value".
- Draws: unchanged rule, but with the model's 26% draw ceiling a draw only shows edge past
  +250, so draws are never staked in practice. Test renamed to say so.
- `ELO_HFA` / `DRAW_BASE` unchanged (grid optimum). Tests updated (fixture default now sits
  in the STRONG band). README soccer status table and signal diagram updated.

## [2026-09-20c] — analysis/05: the soccer analysis loop (Python + R)

### Added
- **`analysis/05_soccer/soccer_loop.{py,R}`** + `_shared/load_soccer.{py,R}`. One script,
  four sections: A. 3-way paper ROI by pick × strength with 5,000-rep bootstrap CI; B. hit %
  and flat ROI by edge band, price band, pick (Wilson); C. Elo calibration bins for
  P(home)/P(draw)/P(away) and 3-way log-loss of the model vs the de-vigged closer; D. refit of
  `ELO_HFA` × `DRAW_BASE` by held-out log-likelihood on the full results table (Elo replay
  re-implemented in both runtimes). CI runs both against an empty `CFB_SOCCER_DB`.

### Findings (first run, 229 backfilled bets / 374 settled snapshots / 39,583 results; Py == R to 1e-14)
- Flat ROI **−9.6%** [−27%, +9%], inconclusive. STRONG +3.6% (n=88), value −17.8% (n=141).
- **Bigger edge, worse hit**: 8–15% → 47.3%; 20–30% → 31.4%; 50%+ → 24.3%. Football's shape.
- Elo home win-probs run 7–9 pp high in the 40–70% bins; away the same; draws about right.
- **The closer is sharper**: 3-way log-loss Elo 1.0555 vs de-vigged closer 1.0207.
- **Priors confirmed**: HFA 60 / DRAW_BASE 0.26 is exactly the grid optimum (HFA 0–120,
  draw 0.20–0.32) on the held-out second half of the results table. No constant changed.

### Docs
- README: soccer "Honest status" is now a findings table; overview, analysis, analysis-loop,
  weekly-loop and CI diagrams show `05`; running blocks and file table updated.
  `analysis/README.md`, `CLAUDE.md` updated. Report footer and constants comment in
  `soccer_edge.py` cite the run.
- Deep soccer detail in README: nine new Mermaid diagrams (flags, data sources, the Elo
  exactly, three-way arithmetic on a real match, soccer ER, the soccer week, inside `05`,
  Sunday coverage funnel) plus an analysis map in `analysis/README.md`. Football flag diagram
  now shows the banner and the new demotions. All 22 blocks parse under Mermaid 11.

## [2026-09-20b] — Pro soccer module, repo renamed to cfb_pro_soccer_2026

### Added
- **`soccer_edge.py`**: pro soccer outlier finder for every league ESPN lists (219 in the
  catalogue) and DraftKings prices. ESPN publishes no predictor for soccer, so the model is a
  self-built Elo table: `--build-elo` stores a year of final scores in `soccer.db` and
  ratings are replayed chronologically (K 20, half for friendlies, HFA 60, goal-difference
  multiplier), never stored, so a backfill uses exactly the rating known on that date.
  Elo → home/draw/away (draw base 26% at parity, shrinking as 4E(1−E)) vs the de-vigged
  DraftKings three-way line. Signals: `ml3` (+8% value / +20% STRONG), `prob-move`,
  `total-move`. Demotions: unrated side (< 8 results) → never staked; draw picks capped at
  value; dogs > +250 capped; outside −300..+400 never. Shares `LIVE_STAKES`, `stake_for`
  and the PAPER ONLY banner with `cfb_edge`. Flags mirror the football tool
  (`--snapshot --report --settle --backfill --top --league --elo-show --paper-show`).
- `tests/test_soccer_edge.py`: 18 cases, no network. CI compiles, lints, tests, `--help`s
  and schema-bootstraps the soccer module too.
- `reports/soccer-<weekday>-<date>.md` report format.

### Changed
- Repo renamed **`cfb_2026` → `cfb_pro_soccer_2026`** (GitHub redirects the old URL). The
  local folder keeps its name so the scheduled task and memory paths still resolve.
- README: title, clone URL, quick start, overview diagram (soccer subgraph), new "Pro
  soccer" section with its own signal diagram and flag table, roadmap and file table.

### Honest status
- No soccer analysis run exists. Every soccer constant is a prior. The paper ledger in
  `soccer.db` and a future `analysis/05_soccer_*` pair decide whether Elo-vs-DK is anything.
- First backfill sample, 2026-09-12/13 (229 paper bets across all leagues, closers + Elo as
  of that day): flat ROI **−14.7%** on $629 staked. STRONG (str 2): 88 bets, 35 W, +3.1%.
  Value (str 1): 141 bets, 44 W, −35%. Two days is not a verdict; it is the reason the
  module is paper only.

## [2026-09-20] — Paper only, overreach cap, ML dead zone, 2025 backfill, analysis/04

Triggered by going 0-for-5 on 2026-09-19 with five ML dogs from the top of the board.

### Fixed
- **bets.csv grading was wrong for every home-side ticket.** `settle_bets` compared the short
  side name typed at `--bet` ("Missouri State") to ESPN's full name ("Missouri State Bears"),
  never matched, and graded every ticket as the away team. The 9/19 ledger showed 3-2 and
  +$16; it was 0-5 and −$24. New `_side_is_home` matches by prefix/substring and refuses to
  grade (leaves the row unsettled, prints to stderr) when the name matches both teams or
  neither. Two regression tests. The 9/12 tickets were graded correctly by luck (all the
  home-side picks lost anyway).

### Added
- **2025 season backfilled** into `data.db`: 16 Saturdays, 775 games, 766 with a DraftKings
  closer and a pre-game FPI projection, flagged `backfill=1`. The paper ledger went from 114
  settled bets to 578. ESPN still serves last season's closers and frozen predictor, so this
  is reproducible with `--date <2025 Saturday> --backfill` on a fresh DB.
- **`analysis/04_deep_dive`** (Python + R, CI-wired): hit % with Wilson 95% CI and flat ROI
  by strength, season, edge band, ML price band, |spread|, dog/fav, home/away, and the
  model's own `truth_p` vs actual hit rate. Point estimates match to the digit across
  runtimes (44 rows). This is the "simulate before you change a rule" script.
- **`stakes_banner()`** printed at the top of the picks board, the top-N board and the report.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** (this file).

### Changed (rules — from the 2026-09-20 analysis run, 795 games / 578 paper bets)
- **`LIVE_STAKES = False`.** No bucket has a 95% CI above zero; the flagged spread side
  covers 49.3% against a 52.4% break-even. Every board says `STAKES: PAPER ONLY`. Stakes are
  still computed and paper-logged so the sample keeps growing.
- **`SPREAD_OVERREACH_PTS = 8.0`.** Δ ≥ 8 is capped at lean and tagged ⚠overreach. Cover
  rate by edge band: Δ3-5 52.6%, Δ5-8 47.6%, Δ8+ 42.5%. The bigger the FPI-vs-DK gap, the
  more often the market is right.
- **`ML_DEAD_ZONE = (100, 150)`.** Moneyline dogs priced +100 to +150 get strength 0 and
  ⚠dead-zone-dog: 30.2% hit, −33% flat ROI on 63 bets, the worst bucket in the sample.
  All five 9/19 tickets were in it.
- **Line-move gating tested and rejected.** "Steam with FPI" covers 47.9% (n=117), steam
  against 52.6% (n=196). The `[steam with]` tag stays informational; the betting guide no
  longer calls it a confirmation.
- `FINDINGS_AS_OF = "2026-09-20"`.

### Docs
- README "Before you bet" rewritten against the new sample; signals diagram gains the two
  demotions and the `LIVE_STAKES` gate; analysis and CI diagrams show four scripts and 47
  tests. `betting_guide.md` opens with the paper-only status and drops the "three
  confirmations" play. `CLAUDE.md` and `analysis/README.md` updated to match.

### Tests
- 42 → 47 cases: `_side_is_home`, short-name home ML regression, overreach cap, ML dead
  zone, paper-only banner.

## [2026-09-14] — Analysis loop re-run, README table

- Constants unchanged; "Before you bet" table refreshed on 96 games / 70 paper bets.

## [2026-09-09] — First analysis loop, CI, branch protection

- `analysis/01`–`03` in Python and R; `FINDINGS_AS_OF` introduced; `main` protected.
- FCS demotion: either side without an FPI rating is never ranked or staked.
